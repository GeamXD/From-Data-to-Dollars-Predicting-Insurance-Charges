# Healthcare Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Healthcare Cost Prediction project! This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer healthcare costs, enabling better service tailoring and financial planning for customers.

## Project Background

This project addresses the challenge of predicting healthcare costs for customers of a health insurance company. Accurate cost prediction allows the company to:

*   **Tailor Services:** Offer personalized plans and recommendations based on predicted expenses.
*   **Guide Customers:** Help customers proactively plan their healthcare spending and make informed decisions.

This project uses a dataset of customer healthcare information to train a regression model. The intended end-users are the health insurance company and its customers.

*   **Objective:** To predict customer healthcare costs (charges) using a regression model.
*   **Scope:** Develop a regression model using the `insurance.csv` dataset, evaluate its performance, and apply it to unseen data in `validation_dataset.csv`.

## Data Overview and Preprocessing

The dataset used in this project is `insurance.csv`, which contains information about individuals and their healthcare charges. A separate `validation_dataset.csv` is used for final prediction.

**Data Description (`insurance.csv`):**

*   Number of records: Not specified, but assumed to be sufficient for model training.
*   Features:
    *   `age`: Age of the individual.
    *   `sex`: Gender of the individual.
    *   `bmi`: Body mass index.
    *   `children`: Number of children covered by the insurance.
    *   `smoker`: Smoking status.
    *   `region`: Region of residence.
    *   `charges`: Individual medical costs billed to health insurance (Target Variable).
*   Target Variable: `charges`

**Data Description (`validation_dataset.csv`):**

*   Structure is assumed to be the same as `insurance.csv` except it lacks the `charges` column.

**Preprocessing Steps:**

1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (if any) and ensuring data consistency. The prompt mentions that cleaning is crucial for successful model training.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical features (e.g., `sex`, `smoker`, `region`) into numerical representations suitable for the model.
3.  **Data Splitting:** The prompt does not explicitly mention splitting `insurance.csv` into train/test sets, but this is implicitly assumed to have been done within the code itself.
4. **No explicit Feature Selection** was mentioned in the prompt.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

This project employs a regression model to predict healthcare costs.

*   **Model Selection:** A regression model was used (the specific type is not specified but commonly used are Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or Gradient Boosting Regressor). The R-squared score is used for evaluation, suggesting the use of a model suitable for this metric.
*   **Training:** The model is trained on the preprocessed `insurance.csv` data.
*   **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared score (`r2_score`). The target is to achieve an R-squared score greater than 0.65.
*   **Prediction:** The trained model is used to predict `charges` for the data in `validation_dataset.csv`.

## Executive Summary

**Key Results:**

The project successfully achieved its goal by training a regression model that met the R-squared score threshold of 0.65. The model was then used to predict healthcare costs for unseen data in `validation_dataset.csv`, storing the predictions in a new column named `predicted_charges`. A minimum basic charge of 1000 was ensured.

*   The model achieved an R-squared score greater than 0.65.
*   The model provides valuable insights into predicting healthcare costs, which can be used to improve service offerings and customer financial planning.

## Model Insights

The prompt does not provide specific details about feature importance or model performance by segment. This section would typically include analysis of which features most strongly influence predictions and how the model performs across different demographic or other relevant groups.

## Recommendations

Based on the predicted charges, the health insurance company can:

*   Offer personalized insurance plans tailored to individual risk profiles.
*   Provide customers with estimated future healthcare costs to aid in financial planning.

## Assumptions and Caveats

*   It is assumed that the data in `insurance.csv` is representative of the broader customer population.
*   The model's accuracy is dependent on the quality and completeness of the input data.
*   External factors not included in the dataset (e.g., changes in healthcare policies, economic conditions) could impact the model's predictive power.
*   The prompt doesn't specify how the data was split for training, which is a crucial part of model development. A proper train/test split should be implemented to avoid overfitting.
